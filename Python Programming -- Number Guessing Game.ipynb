    "__Objective: Create a simple number-guessing game that does the following:__\n",
    "- The program generates a random number between 1 and 20 (inclusive)\n",
    "- The player has to guess the number with hints provided after each guess\n",
    "- The game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct\n",
    "- The game ends when the player guesses the correct number\n",
    "\n",
    "__Requirements:__\n",
    "- Use the random module to generate a random number\n",
    "- Use a while loop to allow the player to keep guessing\n",
    "- Use if-elif-else statements to check the player's guess and give feedback\n",
    "- Use the input function to get the player's guess\n",
    "- The game should tell the player how many guesses they took when they guess correctly"
